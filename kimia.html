        Isopropyl alcohol is an organic compound that has various uses in daily life. This compound is the simplest secondary alcohol. As an organic compound, isopropyl alcohol has physical and chemical properties. These the chemical properties of isopropyl alcohol:
    <strong><li style="color:mediumseagreen">1. Molar Mass  : 60.1 g mol-1</li>
    <li style="color:indigo">2. Density     : 0.786 g/cm3 <em>(at 20 degrees Celsius)</em></li>
    <li style="color:firebrick">3. Soluble in water.</li>

        One of chemical properties of isopropyl alcohol is <strong>Flammable</strong>. This compound could be Burn, if there is oxygen and fuel. Flammable is a chemical properties that easy to reacts with oxygen and can cause a fire. Very rapid reaction can cause an explosion. This material should be keep in a cool place, because if we keep it in a hot place may cause a fire, we also have to separate it from the oxidizing agent, we must to prepare fire extinguisher close by, away from the source of fire,There is an automatic smoke detector / fire detector is provided. Material with Extremely Flammable label has a flash point at 0 ° C and boiling point at 35 ° C. This material is generally a gas at normal temperature and stored in a high-pressure air tube. Materials with the Highly Flammable label have a flash point at temperature of 21 degrees Celsius and boiling point at infinite temperature. The influence humidity for decide the possibility of this material to burn is very large. Therefore, they are usually stored under high humidity conditions.</span></p>

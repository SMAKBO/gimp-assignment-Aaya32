<h1><font color="white">PREPARATION OF ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL</font></h1>

	
	<p style="color:white">
	The present invention relates to the production I of isopropyl alcohol by the direct combination of 1 propylene with water vapor. According to this t invention propylene and water vapor are caused c to combine at high temperatures at atmospheric or increased pressures in the presence of a solid catalyst compounded from phosphoric acid with one or more of the metals manganese, copper, I iron, cobalt or uranium or the oxides or other compounds thereof, the amount of phosphoric acid present in the catalyst being in excess of that required to form the orthophosphate of the metal or metals selected.

In addition to one or more of the metals it is advantageous to incorporate boron, the amount of phosphoric acid used in that event being in excess of that required to form the orthophosphate of boron as well as the orthophosphate of the metal or metals.

The catalyst may be used in the solid state 0in the form of granules, flakes and so forth or may be supported on inert carriers such as electrode carbon and the like, or these materials may be impregnated with the catalyst in liquid form, and subsequently dried. The reaction may be carried out at temperatures of 100-300° C. Atmospheric pressure may be employed or increased pressures up to 100 atmospheres.

The following examples illustrate the manner in which the invention may be carried into effect and the nature of the results obtained:Example I A catalyst was prepared consisting of 2.6 mole35 cules of phosphoric acid, one molecule of manganese oxide, and half a molecule of boric anhydride. Over 100 cc. of this catalyst, at a temperature of 2500 C., propylene mixed with steam in the molar proportions of 11 mulecules of propylene to 9 molecules of steam, was passed, at a rate of 400 litres per hour (calculated at normal temperature and pressure) under a total pressure of 20 atmospheres. The hourly output of isopropyl alcohol was 17.95 grams. The alcohol was obtained in the form of a 6.73% condensate. A small amount of acetone was also formed.

Example II 50 Over the same amount of the same catalyst as in Example I and at a temperature of 250o C., propylene mixed with steam in the molar proportions of 15 molecules of propylene to 5 molecules of steam was passed at the same rate of flow and under the same pressure as in Example .The hourly output of isopropyl alcohol was .3.15 grams, and the alcohol was obtained in he form of a 10.7% condensate. A small amount f acetone was also formed.</p>
